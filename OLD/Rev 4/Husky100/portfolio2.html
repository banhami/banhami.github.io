            <h2>♪ Stage Notes ♪</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">One of the aspects of Stage Notes which I am absoloutely in love with is their inclusiveness. Their mission is to provide
            a place for all students to experience musical theater, regardless of performing arts skill. I have met such a diverse range of people through
            my experience with Stage Notes and am excited to continue to do so.</p>
            <br> <br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Within Stage Notes, I played my role as Keyboard 2, an instrument which covers many sound effects. Typically in an orchestral or
            general musical heirarchy, players usually don't have much say. However within Stage Notes, I felt I had the agency to contribute a significant amount. One
          issue the pit was facing involved instrumental patches (think of them as sound packs for a keyboard which can make the keyboard sound like a guitar, accordion, etc.)
          . We had no idea about what we were going to do regarding patches, so I decided to help find a solution for keyboard 2. With much help from the music director, we
        found the software we needed, and took the time to program over 500 different patches total for the show. Although the experience was time consuming, it also gave me an
      introduction into the world of music production. Now I've got music production as one more thing to explore when I have the time!</p>
      <br> <br>
      <p class="lead mb-5">Through stage notes, I have experienced leadership from an unusual position, driven myself to find a solution, and also discovered some
      new interests along the way. I am excited to be returning to Stage Notes as Keyboard 1 for the Spring production, and look forward to learning much more about the
    world of musicals as I go on. This is why Stage Notes has been essential to my Husky Story.</p>
