            <h2>CSE Educational Outreach</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Being an outreach ambassador has allowed me to connect my motivation for social change to my interest in the field
            of computer science. As an outreach ambassador, I have had the pleasure of working with an excellent team of students and staff who all
          seek to encourage computer science education and diversity. I see educational outreach as a solution to many of the problems we face
        today. So much of society is reliant on technology, so why not apply more of that technology to something good? I seek to inspire the next generation
      of computer scientists by encouraging them to question the norm. I believe computer science should be accessible to all, and that anybody should
    be able to use it to address a problem they see in their life, their community, their society, or even perhaps their world. </p>
    <br> <br>
    <p class="lead mb-5"> As an ambassador, I have had multiple opportunities to lead by example. I show my willingness and eagerness to help in any
    context, and I always try to tie my actions and motivations back to my guiding principles. I know too that I must always keep learning. I learn by talking
  with my peers, and by catering my classes to address topics I want to learn. Currently, I am taking an EDUC 251 class which is on the topic of Seeking
Educational Equity and Diversity. It has taught me much about my role as a teacher and my role as a student, as well as the importance of an individual's stories. I hope
to be able to continue my studies in the realm of education, so that I can continue to better empathize with, learn from, and teach people that I meet.</p>
