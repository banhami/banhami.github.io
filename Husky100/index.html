            <h2>Hi There. I'm Alex!</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">I am a junior currently studying computer science. I live life with the desire to inspire others to promote positve
              change in their communities. I believe that everybody's voice and stories have a right to be heard. And today, with the advances in
              technology that we have, there is no reason for anybody to be silenced. On paper, my Husky Story may have started in September 2015,
            but in many ways I feel it is only just beginning now. I did not make the choice to be truly involved within
          my community until Junior year, and because of that, my 2017 Fall Quarter has been one of my most challenging, yet rewarding, quarters
        thus far. </p> <br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">So what did I do? Well, this fall quarter I dove in and started pursuing my hobbies and interests at a new depth.
              In my stories below, you'll hear from inside the amazing educational outreach team I work with, attend pit-orchestra practice sessions
              for the musical 'The Addams Family', enter Aikido club and see how its officers are establishing a stronger foundation for the future, and
              you'll visit my first apartment to get a glimpse at what living independently has been for me.<p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead mb-5">Not all change comes easily though, and that holds true especially for me. While I invested my time in many new
                  hobbies, I also struggled with my career, trying to align my studies with my guiding principles. I struggled to find motivation in
                  my classes, and frequently asked myself if I was ever in the right place. I questioned the example given to me, the path that most
                  were expected to follow, and I started to slowly pave a new path for myself. After my stories, I will reflect on what I have learned
                  from each of them, and where I feel those experiences will take me.  <p>
