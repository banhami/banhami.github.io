            <h2>Apartment Life</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Living on my own (with roommates) has been an new and exciting experience for me. My freshman year was spent in the dorms,
            sophomore year was spent commuting, and now I am here. I have chosen to include this as a part of my Husky Story because I feel that becoming independent
          and learning to explore while largely on your own is an important facet of college, and one that is often overlooked.  </p>
          <br> <br>
          <p class="lead mb-5">One of the biggest lessons I have learned from living on my own has been that organization is extremely important. Not only in terms
          of your schedule or room, but also in terms of food, hobbies, travel, etc. Living in an apartment has allowed me to grow into my own organized schedule,
        where I make time for new hobbies, explore new foods or ways of cooking, and somehow fit my busy schedule of extra-curriculars and classes into the week
      while still sleeping 7.5 hours every night. I have learned to make time for the priorities my life: Family, Friends, Hobbies, and Goals. </p>
